  infoTexts:
  - In labs like these, robots were assembled and tested before shipment. Defective
    models were broken down and analysed for hard- and software errors.
  - As a consequence of more and more software errors occuring, most of the labs
    had to halt production due to safety issues after countless employees were injured
    by malfunctioning robots.
  - Transportation was mostly managed by the Robotics Transportation Service. The
    transportation network spanned continents and was one of the fastest transportation
    systems of their time.
  - The marching robots forced humans to flee towards the bigger cities for protection.
    The military started reinforcing the key infrastructure leading into the cities.
  - With the city population reaching the hundred millions, robot population increased
    rapidly after they were permitted for everday life. After one year, at least
    50 percent of humans owned a personal robot and the numbers were increasing fast.
  - Humans were clearly inferior to the oncoming mass of robots. They breached the
    defenses of the humans with sheer numbers and the humans were forced to keep
    on fleeing in order to survive.
